Problem Statement:
As i am working on a competition in TEAM UMIC, i will mention the same https://thinkonward.com/app/c/challenges/stranger-sections-2
This is a semantic segmentation competition where you are given 87 labelled images and over 8000 unlabelled images. our task is to make a
semisupervised learning model which is able to segment rock cross section images to identify kerogen micerals belonging to 3 different classes.

detailed timeline for 1 month:
Day 1: understanding Problem Statement, brainstorm different approaches sitting together in a team. 
Day 2: find resources, research papers relevant for compi. 
       allocation of resources among the team.
       organising workflow on notion.
Day 3 - Day 7: Read research papers, discuss new ideas from them with the team.
               Visiting professors or people who have domain knowledge related to the compitition
Day 8 - Day 10: Working on data (collecting, preprocessing)
                find innovative ways to obtain, annotate, augment data.
Day 11 - Day 15: Data Analysis, find relations between data, identify important features
Day 16 - Day 18: Make a baseline model and see how basic architectures are perfoming on the data
Day 19 - Day 24: Improve the model architecture
                 Look for better loss functions
                 Look for complex models
                 Hyperparameter tuning
Day 25 - Day 27: Model testing and deployment
            Buffer of 3-4 days
