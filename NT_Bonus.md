I have faced a bit difficulty in accessing the library facilities. 
Like
1)I am usually confused which books to read
2)I dont know what books are there in the library pertaining to my interests
  (surely there is the website but their webiste search option is pretty bad)
3)I dont know where the books are kept exactly in the library
4)Many a times, a book which i want is issued already

We can make a chatbot which will tell the user

Which books are available in the library for a certain topic which i am interested in?
Out of them, which of them are issued and when will they be available and how many are available?
In short, it will help the library in efficient logistics?

I had a bad time making resume and find it boring also. So i gave my brother my information and he made it for me
So we can make a platform where users will give their information and we will make a resume for them.
