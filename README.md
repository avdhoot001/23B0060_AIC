This is my repo for the solving the assignment for joining the AI Community of IIT Bombay.
Here i started with Q1 
Q1) The question was about fine tuning a pretrained model on a dataset for object detection.
    I have used Tensorflow framework for it
    I have used Pascal voc 2007 dataset for it
I have used for VGG16 pretrained model for fine tuning


Q1)Bonus 
I figured about Vision transformers. 
I read the research paper "Attention is All You Need"                       https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762
                      and "AN IMAGE IS WORTH 16X16 WORDS"                   https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929

Q2) The question was to make a chatbot using RAG and attention mechanism
I tried to implement a very basic architecture


Q3) I tried to understand the maths behind Deep Learning.
    I learnt about various metrics for calculating distances like Manhattan, Chebyshev,
    Minkowski, Hamming, Kullback Leibler Divergence, Hausdorff distance, Dynamic Time Warping, Frechet Distance

I learnt why euclidean distance fail in higher dimensional space.
I then generated a corpus of words and then find there vector embeddings and plotted them
I also calculated their cosine similarity
