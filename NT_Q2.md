SOP:
I have always been fascinated by how our brain works and what goes inside our brain. And therefore in the past few months,
i have gathered a massive interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence. 
And therefore i also joined Machine learning and Localization subsystem of TEAM UMIC. 
Since then i have learned a lot regarding Deep learing. I have also completed DEEP LEARNING SPECIALISATION COURSE by Andrew Ng. 
I really like the math, logic, and algorithms used here and I am passionate about contributing to the advancement of AI. 
Being part of this community will enable me to share my knowledge and findings, participate in joint research projects, and contribute to the collective progress of AI.
I love to work in a team and i also like to make new friends. 
Therefore Joining AI community will really help me explore my interests and help me learn more about this field.
I look forward to the opportunity to be a part of this vibrant and innovative community.
